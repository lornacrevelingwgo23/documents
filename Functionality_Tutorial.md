| 1        | Rust implementation of cryptographic libraries | https://github.com/Ruby-Protocol/Functional_encryption_rust | The rust implementation of [inner product encryption scheme](https://github.com/Ruby-Protocol/Functional_encryption_rust/blob/main/src/dmcfe_ip.rs) is a reimplementation in Rust of C-implementation available in this awesome library [CiFEr](https://github.com/fentec-project/CiFEr). The rust implementation of quadratic polynomial encryption can be found in [here](https://github.com/Ruby-Protocol/Functional_encryption_rust/blob/main/src/quadratic_sgp.rs) The inner product encryption enables the key holder to compute the inner product between the vector corresponding to the private key and the vector associated with the ciphertext. The quadratic polynomial encryption scheme allows a key holder with a key corresponding to a quadratic function _f_ to compute _f_(_x_, _y_), where (_x_, _y_) are the vectors associated with the ciphertext. |
| 2        | Private machine learning based on functional encryption and substrate pallet | https://github.com/Ruby-Protocol/private_ml | This library applies the aforementioned implementation of inner product and quadratic polynomial encryption schemes to the case of machine leanring. It also implements a substrate module that integrates the verification logic of the associated zero-knowledge proof for the legitimacy of the encrypted functional key. |
